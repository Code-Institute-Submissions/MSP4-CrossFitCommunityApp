                Welcome to Hero Community! A global online community for crossfit lovers! Since it's conception in the early '00s CrossFit has taken the world by storm with more people joining in on the allround fitness experience every day. The fun of CrossFit is of course that even though it's an 'individual' sport, it's actually not. You practice CrossFit as a box, a crew, a community; learning from -, comparing to - and coaching each other and together. Hero Community aims to make all CrossFitters the best hero's they can be, motivating them by enabling them to coach and compare here online; either with your own CrossFit box, your CrossFIt friends from other boxes or countries or if you want compare yourself on a national or global scale! Hero Community allows you to keep track of your performances and gives you feedback as to where your performance ranks among your chosen community and the level of your performance as a percentile of the global community. You can comment on each other's performances an view each members level rating. CrossFit aims to keep you fit in an allround fashion; the workouts are therefor grouped into eight categories. Challenge yourself to keep your levels balanced! You can also set goals for each workout by checking what result is needed for to atain the level you are at or your new level goal. NOTE: To retain your level you have to keep working out! Performance results that are more then a year old do not count toward your level! The CrossFit workouts used on this site are so-called "Hero" workouts: named after fallen service women and men who loved the sport. You can do them "Rx" (as prescribed) in order to be able to compare yourself to the community or build towards that and keep track by logging anyway. Depending on the workout the prescribed weights/reps are different for men and women. LET'S GO!
